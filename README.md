# Algorithms Course Tasks

This is a personal repository for my university algorithms course. It contains nearly every task.

## Project structure

Each task is located in its corresponding folder:

- `Workbook 1/` — basic data structures, linked list, trees, BST, range tree
- `Workbook 2/` — AVL tree, red-black tree
- `Workbook 3/` — heap, priority queue, heap sort
- `Workbook 4/` — trie, greedy algorithms

## Language 

All implementations are written in C++.
